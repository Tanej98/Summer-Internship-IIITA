## Trajectory Learning For Stable Bipedal Walking Robots Using Sequential Network

### description
The project is for making a stable bipedal robots walk using sequential network like lstm and gru.
1. Here in this project i used simulation for collecting data for our model.([link](https://github.com/Einsbon/bipedal-robot-walking-simulation))
2. After collection the data we tained lstm and gru model.
